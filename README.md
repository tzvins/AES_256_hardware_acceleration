# AES_256_hardware_acceleration

This project was conducted as part of our electrical engineering degree. In it, we had the goal of demonstrating hardware acceleration of the AES-256 algorithm.
The desire being to find the most optimized design in terms of combination of hardware and software. For more details, please see Project Report in Documentation.

Included in this repository are the Verilog and C files used in each design, a simulation testbench and simulation results, and our final report and presentation.
